    "# Tutorial 4: Advanced modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "After preparing a basic model with the features from audio data and gaining an understanding of the metrics for this challenge it's time to use a more state-of-the-art approach. The model we are about to use is bigger and demands more computation power. The purpose of this tutorial is to help you understand the code that we will be using in the next notebook where we will fine-tune the model on the whole dataset. As we want only to get familiar with the model and its preprocessing, we will use a small sample of data in this notebook.  So if the results here seem to be discouraging please be patient, you will see it will pay off in the next part of the tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we'll use the [🤗 (Hugging face) library](https://huggingface.co/). With its help, we will create the train, validation, and test datasets, preprocess the data, load a pre-trained model, and fine-tune it. By the end of this notebook, you will have a basic understanding of the huggingface library and you will be able to train a much more powerful model than Random Forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those of you who encounter the 🤗 library for the first time let's ask ChatGPT for a short explanation of what it is:\n",
    ">\"Hugging Face is an open-source software library for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification, machine translation, and question-answering. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to pre-trained language models, including state-of-the-art models such as GPT-3 and BERT, allowing developers to quickly build and deploy NLP applications. The library also includes a range of tools for fine-tuning and adapting pre-trained models to specific NLP tasks, as well as for training new models from scratch. Hugging Face has become popular in the NLP community due to its ease of use, flexibility, and strong community support. It is widely used in industry and academia for a variety of NLP applications.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm... that's a good start, but honestly, a more accurate explanation would include information that apart from NLP-oriented models the library provides state-of-the-art solutions for a variety of different Data Science tasks, such as Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning aaaaand **Audio Processing**!\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, backed up by the ChatGPT promise of 🤗 simplicity let's try to use the library to create an audio dataset, preprocess it, and finally fine-tune one of many available models on our classification task. The list of all available audio classifiers can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=audio-classification&sort=downloads), for starters we'll try to use one of the most popular ones - [Audio Spectrogram Transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/audio-spectrogram-transformer#audio-spectrogram-transformer).\n",
    "\n",
    "For those of you who were not convinced by ChatGPT's assurance of 🤗 simplicity and want to have a good understanding of the library first here is an excellent introductory [course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter0/1?fw=pt) that can help you with your first steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "But don't be scared, this notebook will guide you through the basic concepts of the library, so that at the end you will have ready your first hugging face model. Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: For this notebook, you do need a GPU instance!**"

    "As we've mentioned at the beginning we'll use the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (or AST for short) model, which was trained on a dataset called [AudioSet](https://research.google.com/audioset/). While this is the same type of data, it is very different from what we are working with. The AudioSet consists of clips from YouTube, which are nowhere close to insects' sound recordings. This is why we need to perform some preprocessing steps in order to reliably fine-tune the model for our purpose. Let's see what the 🤗 [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/audio-spectrogram-transformer#overview) of the AST model tells us.\n",

ASTFeatureExtractor takes care of this. Note that it uses the AudioSet mean and std by default\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This poses a first challenge - we need to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the input that we are going to plug into our model to use instead of the AudioSet stats. The input to the AST model is a spectrogram, so we need to calculate the stats not from the \"raw\" amplitude arrays that we've just loaded, but from their respective spectrograms. Luckily the *ASTFeatureExtractor* does just that - it extracts the features from the audio data that are needed for the model, which are the spectrogram arrays. Setting the *do_normalize* argument to *False* will return the spectrograms without performing the normalization on them, so that we can calculate the relevant stats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so we can start to code it, right? Well... not exactly yet. If we look at the [ASTFeatureExtractor documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/audio-spectrogram-transformer#transformers.ASTFeatureExtractor) we will learn that the default sampling rate is set to 16 000 Hz. This happens to be the sampling rate of the AudioSet dataset on which the model was pre-trained. As we know from inspecting our dataset in the EDA phase and from the information displayed from looking at the first row of the train and validation sets our sampling rate is higher than that. In order to use the AST model we need first to resample our dataset to the sampling rate of 16 000 and only then calculate the statistics of such preprocessed audio set.\n",

We set it to *models/AST*, so let's use this directory to load the feature extractor and the model from the best checkpoint (note that this is not necessary, as we put in our *TrainingArguments* object an argument called *load_best_model_at_end* and we set it to *True*. This ensures that the variable *model* contains already the best one based on the metric of choice. We just wanted to show you how to load the model from other checkpoints in case you'd like to experiment). With 🤗 library loading the checkpoint it's just a matter of two lines."
